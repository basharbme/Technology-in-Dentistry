# Technology-in-Dentistry
My dentistry graduation thesis.

I'm actually translating it from Italian to English.

The thesis is made to give an overview of modern Medical Imaging management with a practical point of view. It describes how to create 3d models from medical images, how to optimize it for 3D printing and how to print it.

I will continue to update this thesis in an attempt to aggregate all the knowledge usefull for Medical Images Processing from 3D printing to FEA, Machine Learning and Biofabrication.

Feel free to help me in this journey.
